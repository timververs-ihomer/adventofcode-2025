# Day 1 - Advent of Code 2025

## How to Run

Navigate to the `day-1` directory and run:

```bash
go run main.go
```

Or build and run:

```bash
go build -o day1
./day1
```

**Note:** The program reads `input.txt` from the current directory, so make sure you're running it from the `day-1` directory.
